<p>As a manager, have you ever reorganised your meetings to make more efficient use of your already limited time, to fit in that sales presentation, engineering briefing or management coffee? Did it ever occur to you how easy it is to reschedule that 1on1 with Peter, “<em>it’ll be fine in three days, won’t it</em>”? Or did you just cancel it, because “<em>we just talked three weeks ago, he’s working, he’s improving, I don’t see a problem</em>”, and let’s talk next time? It happened to me several times, but after a while, after a series of realisations, I really tried hard to treat 1on1s the way we all should: as one of the most important development and confidence-building opportunities - not only from a managerial point of view, but also as an employee. What’s worth knowing about the subject?</p>
