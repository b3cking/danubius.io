Being lazy means to me that from time to time I am trying to improve myself, my processes, how I live and work. Usually I like to think of myself as a really organized someone with knowledge about SMART goals, planning and measuring, GTD, focus on mental and physical well-being, daily routine, etc. Well, it turned out, I am not nearly that productive as I imagined. Are you?

## Test yourself

Productivity means not only that you are fast and efficient in actually doing stuff, but being extremely clever about what you need to do to achieve your next big thing. It can be your promotion, more free time, hiring a new team member, or petting your dog in your very own garden. And guess what: it is also you, who needs to define this mentioned next milestone. Good leaders, managers, friends, family members can help in this obviously, but noone will know better than you! 

In Chris Sparks' test you will see 20 questions separated into 4 different topics. Every answer can be a number from 1 to 5. If you like to do it as a questionnaire, [here you go](https://www.forcingfunction.com/assessment), but if thinking about them is more than enough for you now, feel free. The questions are below.
