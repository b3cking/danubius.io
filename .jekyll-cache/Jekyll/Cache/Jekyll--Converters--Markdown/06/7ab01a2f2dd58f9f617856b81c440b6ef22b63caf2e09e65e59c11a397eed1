<p><strong>The mentor is not equal to Google, while the mentee has a hard time swimming with a holey life jacket. What to do and not to do, what to pay attention to, while you are a mentor, and what to focus on, if a mentoring program is planned to introduce at your company?</strong></p>

<p>You have just finished a 1.5-year software development bootcamp, or got your degree, graduated from university. You should see a bunch of opportunities in front of you, yet you enter the first job of your life with trembling legs, or right after a career change, get experience in a completely different environment than earlier. You are committed, but also full of questions and doubts. At your new company, they point to an experienced colleague and say (s)he is the one you can turn and talk to, if you have questions or in case of any professional uncertainty â€“ (s)he will be your mentor. Do you calm down, or are you even more nervous?</p>
