I"ê<p>Have you ever been working in a situation as a project manager, business owner, <strong>product owner</strong> on a project or in an organisation, when a major change you have been waited for so long was deployed to production related to an application you were responsible for, and what worked perfectly yesterdayâ€™s now broken, but you couldnâ€™t intervene? Are you familiar with the terms rollback, while you shouldnâ€™t have to? Perhaps you have developed new functions with IT guys, but when you went live, you couldnâ€™t make sure everything was OK before opening it to the full audience of customers?</p>

<p>Have you ever done market segmentation as a <strong>marketing expert</strong>, but it never occurred to you that the app could be used to target specific users, and display differently to some groups than to others? Did you want to try something new, but werenâ€™t sure if it would work? Has IT supported A/B testing so far?</p>

<p>As a <strong>developer or operator</strong>, have you ever not slept the night after a release, because it was impossible to turn off non-operable features, systems were slow to revert to previous state, or there were interdependencies between pieces of code that only a full revert helped? Has it taken days to do a sweaty merge after months of development on several different branches even with some well-written strategy like Gitflow?</p>

<p>Feature flagging is not the Holy Grail, but it can be very helpful to all involved stakeholders in the SDLC.</p>
